# Window10Changer
Changes the UI, Privacy, Security, Services, and Applications of the default windows 10 pro 1809 standard setup.

Currently tested for Windows 10 Pro x64 Version 1809.

Currently, working on more changes.

Used this resource to pin and unpin taskbar items ever since the windows removed the Pin-App command:
